# California Housing Prices - Assignment 2

This repository contains the `.ipynb` files for Assignment 2. The project studies the California Housing dataset to predict house prices. The dataset includes information like location, number of rooms, population, income, and median house value.

* **WIDS_STUDY_OF_MODELS_WEEK2.ipynb**
  This file includes data exploration, visualization, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and building multiple linear regression models to predict house prices.

* **RIDGE_AND_LASSO.ipynb**
  This file includes training and analysis of Ridge and Lasso regression models.

## Key Learnings

* Learned how to explore and understand a dataset.
* Learned how to visualize data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
* Learned how to handle skewed data and detect outliers.
* Learned how to use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* Learned to build and evaluate regression models using MSE, MAE, R², and adjusted R².
* Learned about Ridge and Lasso regression and how they help prevent overfitting.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Load `WIDS_STUDY_OF_MODELS_WEEK2.ipynb` for main analysis.
3. Load `RIDGE_AND_LASSO.ipynb` for Ridge and Lasso regression.
4. Keep the `housing.csv` file in the same path as the notebooks.
